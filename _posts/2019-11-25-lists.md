title: Properly implementing Linked Lists
subtitle: An interesting reference problem
date: '2019-11-25'

Let's go ahead and try to implement a linked list!  We are going to try in a few different languages (C, Rust, and X my theoretical language).

> The Rust implementation is loosly based off the wonderful guide [here](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/index.html)


## Quick Sidenote about Linked Lists

I don't actually like linked lists.  I hold the opinion that except for a few really edge cases they are almost always worst than just a dynamic array (or 'vector' for you C++/Rust peeps).

But I think what makes them interesting is how reference based they are.  Especially for solving the whole doubly linked fiasco basically becoming almost impossible to resolve the references!

> And by impossible I believe you have to use unsafe blocks in Rust (atleast the official std library does!).  You could try to relate the relationship at runtime but that becomes a bit of an efficency pain.


## What is a linked list?

There are typically 2 forms of linked lists.  Singly linked and doubly linked.  I'll focus on singly for the meantime but come back to doubly later on.

Effectively linked lists are a common recursive structure where each 'node' indicates what the following node is.  For example the array `[1, 2, 3]` could be represented as the linked list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> X` (where 'X' represents NULL or the 'empty' list).

A typical C implementation is as follows;

```c
struct node {
    int data; // could be whatever you want...
    struct node *next;
};
```

We often however wrap this in a container class to allow us to insert elements to the front and back in O(1).

```c
struct list {
    struct node *head; // first
    struct node *tail; // last
    // maybe also a length.. or some other stuff
};
```

This is clearly a nightmare to handle safely because if you have access to a given node I could decide to just remove that node from the list...  So let's look at building some rust code from it.

> Note: I won't touch any more C code from this point because it just doesn't show off what I'm trying to look at.  Which is type safety and reference 'liveness' if you haven't guessed.

## Rust's Turn

I'm also just going to use a 'stack' representation (i.e. only pushing/popping) since it's easier to implement and the site I'm taking reference from (for the rust) uses that.  I'm not going to go in great depth over the rust so I recommend that if you aren't following to read up [here](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/second.html).

```rust
    // might as well make it generic
    // <T> just allows us to give it any type
    pub struct List<T> {
    head: Link<T>;
}

// Think of this like a typedef
// just a short hand.
// Box is a pointer that states that the link
// 'owns' the pointer so when the link goes away
// so does the pointer.  For you C++ folks it's a unique_ptr
type Link<T> = Option<Box<Node<T>>>;

// our actual 'nodes'
struct Node<T> {
    elem: T,
    next: Link<T>,
}

impl<T> List<T> {
    // our 'constructor'
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        List { head: None }
    }

    // push a new element onto the stack
    pub fn push(&mut self, elem: T) {
        let new_node = Box::new(Node {
            elem: elem,
            // 'take' is kind of like
            // std::move() in C++
            // It basically states that we
            // are moving the box so that 'next'
            // owns it now.
            next: self.head.take(),
        });

        self.head = Some(new_node);
    }

    pub fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
        self.head.take().map(|node| {
            self.head = node.next;
            node.elem
        })
    }

    pub fn peek(&self) -> Option<&T> {
        // one part of rust that I'm always cautious of
        // is the 'as_ref' and 'as_mut' parts.
        // I feel it's just verbose... If I want to take
        // something as mutable I hate having to implement
        // an identical function...
        self.head.as_ref().map(|node| {
            &node.elem
        })
    }

    pub fn peek_mut(&mut self) -> Option<&mut T> {
        self.head.as_mut().map(|node| {
            &mut node.elem
        })
    }
    
    // I'm going to leave out the iterators because while they are useful
    // I don't think they are relevant to exactly what we are talking about
    // I am going to do another post to compare how awesome iterators are in X
    // but that is for later!
}
```

Okay now this is actually really beautiful in a lot of regards (it's very 'clean') the only massive downside is requiring a peek and peek_mut.

What is interesting is the following code;

```rust
let mut list = List::new();

// Check empty list behaves right
assert_eq!(list.pop(), None);

// Populate list
list.push(1);
list.push(2);
list.push(3);

let first = list.peek();
list.push(10);
list.pop();
```

You may expect that rust would hate this code since we are taking a reference to an element then we are trying to push a new one on.  Or you may think that it's okay with the push (since it wouldn't effect our reference) but the pop is the problem.  But this perfectly compiles.  Because you aren't using 'first' so it's scope is only till the list.push().

If we later on decide to use it...

```rust
let mut list = List::new();

// Check empty list behaves right
assert_eq!(list.pop(), None);

// Populate list
list.push(1);
list.push(2);
list.push(3);

let first = list.peek();
list.push(10);
list.pop();
match first {
    Some(x) => println!("{}", x),
    None => {}
}
```

Then rust complains;

```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `list` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
   --> src/lib.rs:119:5
    |
118 |     let first = list.peek();
    |                 ---- immutable borrow occurs here
119 |     list.push(10);
    |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
120 |     list.pop();
121 |     match first {
    |           ----- immutable borrow later used here
```

It's a pretty nice error since it lays everything out (and we get another error for the pop as well).  I do think we should be allowed to push things onto the list but the borrow checker is over protective.

> Rust may be 'correct by default' but it does have a lot of tradeoffs and this is one of them.

## X's turn

Okay X is my theoretical language so as usual a lot is prone to change but I'll explain things as we go.

Let's begin with our definition for our node.

```swift
// 'xuple' is a special struct
// we can give multiple possibilities
// it's closest relative is an Algebraic Data Type
// like Rust's Enum or Haskell's type class
// We use [T] as generics instead of <T>
xuple Node[T] = (val: T, next: *Node[T]);
// Pointers are implemented as something like;
// xuple Ptr[T] = () | Raw[T];
// where the () is an empty tuple (our NULL)
// in reality '*' is a special type and can be changed
// by the caller as we'll see.
```

Okay and our 'list' or Stack as I'll call it...

```swift
xuple Stack[T] = (head: Ptr[Node[T]]);
```

This may seem like it'll lead to problems of memory leaks or memory issues but we'll see what happens soon!  Let's write some helper functions.

> Normally we use something called a context variable to pass around a custom allocator.  I'm not going to do that here because I think it'll detract from the implementation (and potentially confuse people) and instead just use a magical 'global.alloactor' variable which normally wouldn't exist.  It really doesn't add any more complexity but as you are probably seeing this for the first time I want to slowly ease you into it.


```swift
#override constructor
private member Node.new[T] = (item: T, next: *Node[T] = ()) -> Node[T] => {
    // alloc_with would actually be a compile time function (kinda like a
    // macro but it is running literal code and isn't really text replacement).
    // you can do a lot of meta stuff with compiletime functions but that's for later.
    return global.allocator[Node[T]].alloc_with(item, next);
}

#override constructor
// technically this is really (())
// but we can figure out that you mean those nested brackets
// you could also write it as (head: ())
member Stack.new[T] = () -> Stack[T] => ();

member Stack.push[T] = (stack: *Stack[T], item: T) => {
    node := Node[T].new(item, stack.head);
    stack.head = node;
}

member Stack.pop[T] = (stack: *Stack[T]) -> () | T => {
    if (!stack.head) return ();
    node := stack.head;
    stack.head = stack.head.next;
    return node.item;
}
```

> And we'll come to peek in a second...

Okay so what would happen if this got 'compiled' (theory language so no compiler *yet*)... Well first off we need a use case for it (it wouldn't care otherwise in this case).  Also note that it would give a warning since a possible binding will fail (as we'll see) but we are going to 'ignore' that for now.

```swift
main := () => {
    list := Stack.new[Int]();
    // 'X' is nice and will realise stuff like this
    // and just change it to Stack.push(list, 2);
    list.push(1);
    list.push(2);
    list.push(3);
}
```

Well when we run this it also is fine...  But wait why doesn't it care about lifetimes?  Okay we could try to get it to tell us what decisions it has made (using some magic compiler flag) or we could try to pop something and see if that changes things...

```swift
main := () => {
    list := Stack.new[Int]();
    // 'X' is nice and will realise stuff like this
    // and just change it to Stack.push(list, 2);
    list.push(1);
    list.push(2);
    list.push(3);
    
    list.pop();
    list.pop();
    list.pop();
}
```

> Typically we either don't worry about the choices (presuming they are optimal) or we enforce constraints such as certain index patterns.

Let's constrain it!  We have a few choices but I'm going to begin with `#owner` which is effectively `Box<>`

```swift
main := () => {
    // this makes list a sole owner of it's children
    // this #owner will propagate through to it's children
    // effectively it means 'main' is an owner of list
    // therefore 'main' also has to be an owner of list's children
    #owner list := Stack.new[Int]();

    // 'X' is nice and will realise stuff like this
    // and just change it to Stack.push(list, 2);
    list.push(1);
    list.push(2);
    list.push(3);
}
```

Okay the push code is fine but if we do pop! (I won't leave the suspense any longer this will fail!)

```swift
main := () => {
    #owner list := Stack.new[Int]();
    // 'X' is nice and will realise stuff like this
    // and just change it to Stack.push(list, 2);
    list.push(1);
    list.push(2);
    list.push(3);
    
    // ERROR!!
    list.pop();
    list.pop();
    list.pop();
}
```

The error is to do with the implementation of pop which is;

```swift
member Stack.pop[T] = (stack: *Stack[T]) -> () | T => {
    if (!stack.head) return ();
    
    // implicit move
    node := stack.head;
    
    // we are accessing head after the move above
    stack.head = stack.head.next;
    return node.item;
}
```

So if we instead write it to...

```swift
member Stack.pop[T] = (stack: *Stack[T]) -> () | T => {
    if (!stack.head) return ();
    
    // implicit move
    node := stack.head;
    
    // we are accessing head after the move above
    stack.head = node.next;
    return node.item;
}
```

Then this code will be fine!  A slight problem would occur if we tried to access node.next after the `stack.head` assignment since we just moved it but again that could be fixed by setting it to `()` after the move.

> Basically our #owner works like C++'s unique ptr but moves are compiler errors rather than just a runtime error if you try to access the data.

Now let's write peek...

```swift
member Stack.peek[T] = (stack: *Stack[T]) -> *T => {
    if (!stack.head) return ();
    // adding a '*' always references an object
    // .* is dereference
    return *stack.head.item;
}
```

Okay and the use case...

```swift
main := () => {
    // this makes list a sole owner of it's children
    // this #owner will propagate through to it's children
    // effectively it means 'main' is an owner of list
    // therefore 'main' also has to be an owner of list's children
    #owner list := Stack.new[Int]();

    // 'X' is nice and will realise stuff like this
    // and just change it to Stack.push(list, 2);
    list.push(1);
    list.push(2);
    list.push(3);
    
    item := list.peek();
    if item  println("\{item.*}");
}
```

This compiles fine!  But wait why...  Well basically 'list' is the owner so as long as we don't try to use list before using item we'll be fine.

> Effectively #owner is like a really simple borrow checker for cases like this... we have more powerful tools but the point is you just opt into which one you need at which time or just let it guess for you.

If we then try to repeat what we did before...

```swift
main := () => {
    // this makes list a sole owner of it's children
    // this #owner will propagate through to it's children
    // effectively it means 'main' is an owner of list
    // therefore 'main' also has to be an owner of list's children
    #owner list := Stack.new[Int]();

    // 'X' is nice and will realise stuff like this
    // and just change it to Stack.push(list, 2);
    list.push(1);
    list.push(2);
    list.push(3);
    
    item := list.peek();
    
    list.push(1);
    if item  println("\{item.*}");
}
```

We get a compiler error :( because are trying to utilise list then item.  We can fix this (and we will actually get a warning hopefully about this) using this implementation for push...

> The problem is that in the `Node[T].new(item, stack.head);` the `stack.head` bit is causing a move if we instead denote and exchange

```swift
member Stack.push[T] = (stack: *Stack[T], item: T) => {
    // we basically just have to write it out a bit more explicitly
    // so the compiler understands that stack.head doesn't actually
    // get 'moved' to the point that any references become invalid
    // if we are lazy we can just chuck a #non_destructive(stack.head)
    // and it'll do a simple double check.  We could also just write it better
    
    // by using 'bind' which states that 'node' now belongs to Stack
    // so even though stack.head is moved it still is owned by stack
    // which means it's fine!
    #bind(stack) node := Node[T].new(item, stack.head);
    stack.head = node;
}
```

Yay our code now works.  Of course we can't do this with pop with `#owner` (if you remove it the pop will work even with accessing the item afterwards because it'll just use a shared reference).  But we can do better!  Let's do so much better by utilising weak in our peek.

What this means is that all of our nodes now will also carry a control unit for weak references basically this means that we can still pop our node and all that but we can still access our weak pointers the only thing that'll occur is that the pointer will become () in the case that we popped that specific node.

```swift
main := () => {
    // this makes list a sole owner of it's children
    // this #owner will propagate through to it's children
    // effectively it means 'main' is an owner of list
    // therefore 'main' also has to be an owner of list's children
    #owner list := Stack.new[Int]();

    // 'X' is nice and will realise stuff like this
    // and just change it to Stack.push(list, 2);
    list.push(1);
    list.push(2);
    list.push(3);
    
    #weak item := list.peek();
    list.pop();
    list.pop();
    list.pop();
    
    if item  println("\{item.*}");
    else     println("No item");
}
```

> The above code will print 'No item'!  Wow.  We do pay for this weak pointer in having control units for all our nodes (since it can't tell which node is which) but it is still pretty cool!

You know what is even cooler!

```swift
...
    #shared item := list.peek();
...
```

Will produce the following;

```
Can't take both a single ownership (#owner) and multiple ownership (#shared) of the same object
... (more error information)

Potential Fixes:
- Turn #shared to #weak this means that we aren't invalidating ownership but as soon as the owner drops it then it'll become an empty pointer and become invalidated
  The following call may make it invalidated:
  list.pop() (3 calls total)
- Turn #owner to #shared (and you can remove the #shared from the item) this makes the whole xuple shared.  It'll encur a small speed cost but will let you have multiple ownership.
```

## Comparison

Some benefits of X is that the code is shorter (but quite a bit) and we don't have to mess around with all this 'mut' and junk.  The huge benefit though is that we get free pushes without having to invalidate our node.  And we can choose to not even have to invalidate our item if we want to pay the small cost of weak pointers (note: Since we declared it as #owner it won't use full shared pointers and just store a single integer as the weak pointer reference count with the node most likely since the allocation is small so it really isn't a huge cost... It won't even use atomics if it detects no thread stuff).

Hopefully that was interesting :).
