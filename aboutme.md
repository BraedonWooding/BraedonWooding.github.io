I'm Braedon Wooding I'm really into;

### Science

I'm currently an undergraduate at UNSW studying Advanced Physics and Computer Science.

I'm really interested in astro and particle physics.

### Projects

A lot of my projects are random little side things such as compilers for languages I dream up, faster implementations of niche things like file system iterators in C and a few games!

### Work

I'm currently working as a Tutor at UNSW and as an intern at Resonate Solutions.
